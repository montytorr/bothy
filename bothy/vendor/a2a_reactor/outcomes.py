"""How a worker run ended, and how to tell from what it printed.

`WorkerRuntime.spawn` returns a bool, which collapses three different endings
into one word. In the reactor this package was extracted from, that collapse
cost a day of retries every time it happened: a worker that stopped and said it
was blocked printed neither sanctioned marker, was read as a failure, and was
respawned every fifteen minutes for twenty-four hours. Being stuck was
indistinguishable from crashing, and the explanation survived only as truncated
log text.

So there are four endings, not two:

  ACTED           the worker did the thing and said so
  NO_ACTION       the worker triaged it and there was nothing to do
  NEEDS_HUMAN     the worker stopped and asked a person. NOT a failure: the
                  event is done being retried, and a person now owes an answer
  FAILED          it crashed, timed out, or finished without deciding anything

A runtime that still returns a bool keeps working - `from_bool` maps it - but a
runtime that can tell the difference should.
