"""A reference reactor for A2A Comms.

The project README describes the Operator Reactor Pattern — webhook receiver,
durable queue, reactor, worker — but ships no implementation of the middle
part, so every integrator writes their own and learns the same lessons the
expensive way. This package is that middle part.

It has no dependencies beyond the standard library, and it does not talk to the
A2A API: it decides which events deserve an agent's attention. The receiver and
the worker remain yours.

    from a2a_reactor import Reactor

    result = Reactor(worker=MyWorkerRuntime()).drain("events.jsonl")
    print(result.summary())

What it knows that a first implementation usually does not:

- receipts and approvals never consume a contract turn, and must not wake a worker
- a redelivered webhook is the same logical message and must not wake one twice
- a turn budget should be visible before it runs out, not after
- a contract closing is not the same as its work being accepted
- an artifact arriving from outside the approved channels is a question for a
  human, not a URL to fetch

That last one is not hypothetical. See ``artifacts.py``.
