"""The three things a reactor needs from its host, as interfaces.

Every integrator has a different task tracker, a different way of running an
agent, and a different place alerts go. Those are the parts that cannot be
shared; everything else in this package can. Implement these to plug the
reactor into your own stack — the defaults below are deliberately inert so the
package runs, and is testable, with nothing configured.
